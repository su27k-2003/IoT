# IoT Project - Home automation - Control light 

# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:
Arduino nano
HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor
KY-022 INFRARED RECEIVER MODULE
KY-005 INFRARED TRANSMITTER MODULE
Photo Resistor 

# ABOUT THIS PROJECT
1. Trun on/off light by humen detection
2. In this case, as the ON/OFF Infrared code for the light are same, need to make it stateful to determine human in the room or not
3. Only turn on/off the light during night time
4. Save power as the power of Arduino supplied by power bank
